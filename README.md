# FnProgramming
Learning resources for functional programming

This is an introductory presentation on what functional programming is,
along with code examples in JavsScript, Python, and Ruby which demonstrate
how the principels of functional programming can be applied in various
languages.

The presentation is written in KeyNote. If KeyNote is not available, then
a PDF has also been provided. The PDF has each action available on new slides,
so while it may be complete, it may appear somewhat reddundant.
